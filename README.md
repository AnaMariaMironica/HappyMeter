# Happy Meter
The degree of happiness of an employee in a day or a longer period of time could impact the performance and efficiency at work. 
<strong>HappyMeter</strong> could curb this hunch by tracking the negative and positive flow of employees, helping management to recognize troublesome trends
and hopefully nip them in the bud before they grow.
